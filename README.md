React Intl Mixin
================

This repository contains a [ReactJS][] Component [Mixin][] to implement Internationalization
features in a react component. The Intl Mixin provides a series of methods that
can be used in the `render()` method of the component to provide date formatting,
number formatting, as well as plural and gender based translations.

## Installation

### Browser

1. Install with [bower][]: `bower install react-intl`
2. Load the scripts into your page.

    ```html
    <script src="path/to/react.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/intl-messageformat.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/react-intl.js"></script>
    ```

_note: for older browsers, and safari, you might need to also load [Intl.js][] polyfill before
including [intl-messageformat][] library._

3. Creating a React component with the Intl mixin:

    ```javascript
    var MyComponent = React.createClass({
      mixins: [ReactIntlMixin],
      getMyMessage: function () {
        return "{product} cost {price, number} if ordered by {deadline, date}"
      },
      render: function () {
        return <div>
          <p>{this.intlDate(new Date())}</p>
          <p>{this.intlNumber(600)}</p>
          <p>{this.intlMessage(this.getMyMessage(), {
            product: 'Mac Mini',
            price: 2000.0015,
            deadline: 1390518044403
          })}</p>
        </div>;
      }
    });
    ```

4. Using the React component by specifying the `locales`:


    ```javascript
    React.renderComponent(
      <MyComponent locales={["fr-FR"]}/>,
      document.getElementById('example')
    );
    ```

### Node/CommonJS

1. You can install the mixin with npm: `npm install react-intl`
2. Load in the module and register it:

    ```javascript
    var ReactIntlMixin = require('react-intl');
    ```

## Advanced Options

### Date and Time formatters

#### Explicit formats

By default, when using `{this.intlDate(new Date())}` and `{this.intlNumber(600)}`, `react-intl` will use the default format for the data, and the default numeric format for the number. To specify a custom format, you have two ways, passing a second argument with the specific format you want to use. The following examples will ilustrate this option:

    ```javascript
    var MyComponent = React.createClass({
      mixins: [ReactIntlMixin],
      render: function () {
        return <div>
            <p>A: {this.intlDate(1390518044403, { hour: 'numeric', minute: 'numeric' })}</p>
            <p>B: {this.intlNumber(400, { style: 'percent' })}</p>
        </div>;
      }
    });
    ```

In the example above, if `locales` is set to `["fr-FR"]`, the output will be:

    ```html
    A: 18:00
    B: 40 000 %
    ```

But if `locales` is set to `["en-US"]`, the output will be:

    ```html
    A: 6:00 PM
    B: 40,000%
    ```

This explicit way to specify a format works well for simple cases, but for complex applications, it falls short because you will have to pass these values everywhere. Also, it doesn't work with complex structures processed by `intlMessage()` because there is no way to pass the formatter for each individual element. To overcome this limitation, we introduced the custom formatters.


#### Custom formats

With custom formatters, you can specify a set of rules that can be apply to your entire application, or for a section of the page (a component and its child components). These custom formatters can also be used thru `intlMessage()` API for complex language sentences. The following examples will ilustrate this option:

    ```javascript
    var MyContainer = React.createClass({
      mixins: [ReactIntlMixin],
      getDefaultProps: function() {
        return {

          // hardcoding formats as properties, but they can be passed from parent...
          "formats": {
            "date": {
              "timeStyle": {
                "hour": "numeric",
                "minute": "numeric"
              }
            },
            "number": {
              "percentStyle": {
                "style": "percent"
              },
              "eur": {
                "style": "currency",
                "currency": "EUR"
              }
            }
          },

          // using properties or a mixin to bring the messages in different languages...
          "MyMessage": "{product} cost {price, number, eur} if ordered by {deadline, date, timeStyle}"

        };
      },
      render: function () {
        return <div>
            <p>A: {this.intlDate(1390518044403, "timeStyle")}</p>
            <p>B: {this.intlNumber(400, "percentStyle")}</p>
            <p>{this.intlMessage(this.props.MyMessage, {
              product: 'Mac Mini',
              price: 2000.0015,
              deadline: 1390518044403
            })}</p>
        </div>;
      }
    });
    ```

In the example above, if `locales` is set to `["fr-FR"]`, the output will be:

    ```html
    A: 6:00 PM
    B: 40,000%
    C: Mac Mini cost â‚¬200 if ordered by 6:00 PM
    ```

By having defined `this.props.formats`, which specifies a set of named formats under `date` and `number` members, allow us to use those named formats as a second argument for `intlNumber()` and `intlDate()`, but also allow us to reference them as a third token when defining the messages, e.g: `{deadline, date, timeStyle}`, which describes the format options for `deadline` value, specifying that it is a `date` and should be formatted using `timeStyle` custom formatter.

### App Configuration

Another feature of the Intl Mixin is its ability to propagate `formats` and `locales` to any child component. Internally, it laverages `context` to allow those child components to reuse the values defined at the parent level, making this ideal to define custom formatters for the app, and the language or the application by defining them or passing them into the root component when rendering the application. Ideally, you will do this:

    ```javascript
    var appLocales = ['en-US'];
    var appFormats = { number: {}, date: {} };
    React.renderComponent(
      <MyRootComponent locales={appLocales} formats={appFormats} />,
      document.getElementById('container')
    );
    ```

Then make sure `MyRootComponent` implement the `ReactIntlMixin`. By doing that, you can define the list of `locales`, normally one or more in case you want to support fallback, (e.g.: `["fr-FR", "en"]`); and you can define the `formats` to describe how the application will format dates and numbers. And all child components will be able to inherit these two structures in such a way that you don't have to propagate or define `locales` or `formats` at any level in your application, just apply this mixin in those components that are suppose to use `this.intlNumber()`, `this.intlDate()` and/or `this.intlMessage()` in the `render()` method and you're all set.

Limitations
-----------

Not all browsers have implemented [ECMAScript 402][], which is the internationalization API, for older browsers, and Safari, you might need to patch the browser by loading [Intl.js][] polyfill before
including [intl-messageformat][] library.
